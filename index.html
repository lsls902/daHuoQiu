    <div>
        On December 17 2024, the National Immigration Administration of China announced that the stay period for foreigners eligible for visa-free transit in China would be extended to <b>240</b>(before 144 hours) hours. Meanwhile, 21 additional ports were newly designated as ports for the entry and exit of visa-free transit personnel, further expanding the areas where they can stay and move around. After the new policy was released, eligible personnel from 54 countries including Russia, Brazil, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada, who are transiting through China to a third country (region), can enter China without visas through any of the 60 ports open to the outside world in 24 provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the Central Government), and are allowed to travel across provincial regions within the areas where staying and activities are permitted in these 24 provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the Central Government).
